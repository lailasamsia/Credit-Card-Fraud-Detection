## Project Overview
The project to detect credit card fraud at a bank based on its important features. This project is a challenging task by Shift Academy held in Kaggle. I am performing comprehensive EDA on Credit Card Fraud dataset to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers and apply machine learning model. The model used for this project is logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, knn and the best model based on its roc/auc score is logistic regression.
